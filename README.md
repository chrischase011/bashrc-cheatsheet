# .bashrc Cheatsheet - Shortcut Commands

My own .bashrc file uses alias that you can use in your development. This file can speed-up your development without typing long commands. 

__Note:__ You must have __Git Bash__, __WSL__, __Linux OS__, __macOS__ or any platform/software that can run __Bash shell (or a compatible shell)__ to make it work.

This .bashrc provides shortcut command for:
- #### Basic Bash commands
- #### NPM Core
- #### Nuxt
- #### Git
- #### Vite
- #### Laravel

You can send pull request to provide more shortcut commands to this .bashrc file.
